This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## ðŸš€ Deploying to Firebase Hosting

To deploy the app to Firebase Hosting, follow these steps:

1. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Export the static site:**

   ```bash
   npx next export
   ```

   This will generate a static `out/` directory with the production-ready files.

3. **Deploy to Firebase:**

   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```

Make sure your `firebase.json` is configured to use the `out/` directory as the `public` folder.
